// anything changes either side:
//   - the source is about to be overwritten whole (both aspects cleared): the two images swap - the destination
//     keeps the contents without a copy, the source is cleared in the destination's old image;
//   - the destination is about to be overwritten in some aspects (its depth cleared): only the other aspects are
//     copied (stencil, a quarter of the bytes);
//   - anything else (a draw writing depth / stencil, a partial clear, a copy or upload into either, the
//     destination bound as an attachment, a texture freed or reallocated): the real copy is made first.
// Only same-size, same-format, single-level, single-sample depth/stencil images, whole-image copies.

// ---- the arena: shader global memory that stays on the GPU (LARECOMP_VK_NO_GRES=1: off)
// The copies above are taken when a draw is translated, but a compute shader's output only reaches guest memory once
// its submission is done. The game's lighting is such a case: each frame a compute dispatch writes the light list
// (~34 KB) and then over a hundred draws' fragment shaders read it - from copies made before the dispatch had run:
// no lighting on Qualcomm's driver (Turnip reads the heap itself). So every draw and dispatch reaches global memory
// through one buffer, the arena: a range a shader stores to gets a slot there for good (resident), and everything
// after it that touches that range - the dispatch itself next frame, the draws - uses the slot, in GPU order; the
// other ranges are copied per draw into the arena's ring, as before. The CPU's writes to a resident range (the game
// clearing a counter each frame) are found by comparing the range with what was last uploaded, 256 bytes at a time,
// and copied into the slot by the GPU at the start of the submission. What a shader stored also goes back to guest
// memory once its submission is done (the game reads some of it as uniform buffers, vertices, textures), and to the
// range's last-uploaded copy, so that isn't taken for the CPU's write.
